## What is Monolith?

Monolith is built on top of Rails and helps you *think more clearly about what you're building* by giving you the content, tools, and libraries you need to ship a product to the world. Instead of giving you All The Thingsâ„¢ at once, it lets you work in discrete phases guiding you along the way.

1. **Idea** - Write the copy for your product and collect email addresses for launch time.
2. **Prototype** - Quickly build a prototype of your application and start getting feedback. You'll get what you need to setup basic login functionality.
3. **Launch** - Once you're happy with the prototype, its time to launch! Setup payment, install a terms of service, and more.
3. **Scale** - If all goes well you'll have customers paying for your app and you'll need to add features or capacity.

It's used by [Rocketship](https://rocketship.io) to build, ship, and deliver SaaS products to paying customers.

## How is it different than other SaaS toolkits?

There's a ton of great SaaS toolkits out there like [Jumpstart](https://jumpstartrails.com) and [Bullet Train](https://bullettrain.co), both definitely worth checking out. Most SaaS frameworks focus on giving you a bunch of features all at once, which can make it harder to think clearly about what you want to build.

Monolith takes a different approach and gives you what you need when you need it. It guides you along the way in both technical, marketing, and promotional matters.

## What is it technically speaking?

Monolith is a curated collection of libraries and methods that optimize for low operational complexity. What does that mean exactly?

1. **Minimize generated code** - Generated code is easy at first, but it can become hard to change as future requirements change.
2. **Low customer service requirements** - The people behind Monolith have experience opearting SaaS applications and know the areas that waste a lot of customer service time and energy like password resets, adding people to accounts, etc.
