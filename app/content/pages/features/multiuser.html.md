title: Multiple Users

It's recommended to support multiple users on all accounts.

At first this seems like something that only business SaaS products should support, but it's also useful for consumer-to-consumer apps. You will want to limit the number of users on an account so that you can charge per-seat licenses as your app grows.

For family/consumer apps, consider setting the limit for number of seats at 6, which should cover the size of most families. For additional users beyond that consider a support policy that either gives large families more seats (they need a break) or charge a modest fee.

For business-to-business apps, consider per-seat licensing.
