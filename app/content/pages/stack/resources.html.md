Generated code tends to have the problem of being hard to change if you need to change a lot of it. For example, if a lot of scaffolds are used to build a Rails application, a *lot* of files are generated that each have to be individually changed later.

Monolith prefers to generate views and scaffolding in code, as opposed to generating lots of files.
